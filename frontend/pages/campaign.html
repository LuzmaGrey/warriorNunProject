                        <h1 class="text-display-title">We Fight</h1>

                        <p class="lead">This is for all the shows featuring queer women which didn’t get any promotion
                            and weren’t allowed to breathe and find their audience.

                            If 2016 was the year of the “bury your gays” trope, then 2022 solidified the “cancel your
                            gays” trend with shows featuring queer women getting axed left and right. The list of shows
                            canceled by streaming companies keeps growing as the expectations for their performance keep
                            changing making it impossible for any show that isn’t the biggest, most promoted blockbuster
                            to succeed and get more than 2 seasons.

                            Netflix cancelled Warrior Nun on December 14th, 2022, and the reason the Warrior Nun
                            cancellation caused such an uproar is because it made us ask ourselves: when will our shows
                            and stories be good enough so we won't have to beg to see them completed?

                            Warrior Nun received excellent ratings from critics and fans alike. It remains the best
                            rated second season of a Netflix show on Rotten Tomatoes and it checked all the boxes of a
                            "good show". And all this was done with $0 in marketing and promotion from Netflix. They
                            made the show, didn’t allocate a single dime in promotion in order to get those viewership
                            numbers to meet their current standards, and then canceled it. We’ve seen this over and over
                            again. These are shows portraying minority stories- there’s no way around it. It will be
                            almost impossible to get the same numbers for Warrior Nun, First Kill or The Wilds that you
                            get for The Crown or Stranger Things. But that has to be ok. That has to be enough.

                            These stories still matter and they deserve to survive. Commitment to diversity means
                            commitment to shows that won’t always find their audience in the majority. Commitment to
                            diversity means commitment to giving these stories the attention, promotion and funding they
                            deserve. Commitment to diversity means giving these shows a fighting chance, not deciding
                            that they’re going to get canceled before a season even airs and withholding any type of
                            promotion or marketing.

                            We’re angry and done begging for representation. Our stories matter. Right now, we’re
                            channeling all that anger into saving Warrior Nun, getting Netflix and every other platform
                            to pay attention and reconsider their approach. In order to do that, we need to make as much
                            noise as possible.
                            Will you help us?

                                To quote Netflix's most recently canceled show, Warrior Nun, In This Life or The Next.

                                Recent reflection on this phrase has prompted the greater sapphic community to examine
                                the relevance of its meaning, considering how often we seem to be hearing it uttered in
                                relation to sapphic media. As of December 14th, fans worldwide were made aware of
                                Netflix's-your- decision to cancel the series, Warrior Nun, one of the last standing
                                sapphic-led programs across all streaming platforms.

                                To say we, as fans and Netflix subscribers are devastated is an understatement.
                                Suppression of LGBT stories in media is not a new phenomenon, yet the recent spike in
                                cancellations of sapphic-led programs is revealing itself to be an alarming and ongoing
                                trend amongst streaming platforms.
                                We as fans put not only money into our subscriptions for Netflix and others, but faith
                                in these platforms that claim to provide quality entertainment and diverse media. When
                                that diverse media is given meager resources and expected to perform like their heavily
                                funded and promoted counterparts, these programs are already being set up to fail- and
                                often do due to their circumstances.

                                This, inevitably, results in these sapphic-led and/or female-led programs being
                                canceled, forced to end on whatever chapter they were last left, effectively silencing
                                the message each of these frozen-in-time stories has to offer. Our question is this:
                                When is, enough, enough?

                                How many more diverse stories will have to fight to stay above water, only to drown in a
                                cancellation due to ever-shifting goalposts? How much longer do we as LGBT/sapphic
                                viewers have to fight and struggle to hold onto even a single meaningful story that is
                                eventually dashed away by the platforms that claim to care?

                                The story of Warrior Nun transcended its status as a program- it has literally changed
                                lives. Having touched so many people, stories like Warrior Nun give its audience a
                                chance to see themselves in the characters portrayed on screen, allowing viewers to
                                think, "This is my story, and I am being heard." Representation of marginalized
                                communities on screen is critical to their normalization in the material world because
                                our stories are normal and are deserving of time to develop naturally through a thorough
                                and complete narrative.

                                So, Netflix, what else has to be done to prove to you that our stories are worth
                                witnessing in this life and the next?
